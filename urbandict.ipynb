When the hood is lifted however the engine isn't a VTEC and there is no Nitrous Oxide system Installed. ;; When challenged to a race ricers will almost always and laugh and drive away with there exhaust making you deaf for a tempary amount of time. On occasion a ricer will make the mistake of pulling up with the Rap blaring and ask a guy in a small low powered car to 'rice' becasue they can't say race. The person will almost always decline the 'rice' but if they accecpt they will win because the ricer drives his car in first gear only becasue it is louder than the higher gears.  \n",

Yes, I say 'popular' because he sings on subjects that are inferior enough for mainstreamers, teenyboppers and hoodrats to relate to. Obviously according to this man's music club-hopping is the center of his life, he falls in love with women with ribald job positions (i.e. stripper) and he has a weird obsession with drinks or buying people drinks. ;; He is NOT R&B. He is the commercial-pop version of R&B. And anyone who think he is the best or 'hot' need to die. This generation of young adults need to jump off a bridge.  \n",

However, DeP is now defined as the entertainer that is conquering the music industry and legions of fans across the country, with his soultry, seductive and sexy sound. Touching one heart and soul at a time, D?P is establishing himself and simultaneously remaining true to his calling, by writing music that paints a canvas of love, pain, and most importantly D?P soul-searching.  \n",

Multi-task music software created by Apple. Used to synchronize the [iPod], organize compressed music files, listen to files, and purchase files from an online store at the price of a dollar each. Loved and hated during its introduction in 2003-2004 because it brought about a revolution in how consumers purchase music. ;; 2. The organization software that comes with the Apple [iPod]. ;; 3. The bringer of multiple clones of the original iTunes software, such as Real's RealRhapsody. Started the online music purchasing craze.  \n",
       "1631  Pretty much everyone who has written a definition for Jay is a fucking idiot. Jay-Z is one of the most lyrically brilliant rappers in raps short history. Thats not arguable its a fact. It is true that he began to commercialize his rap after his outstanding debut album Reasonable Doubt (one of the best rap albums in history) and that was unfortunate, but he turned it around with the Blueprint which was a great album and Blueprint 2 and Black Album were also very good. If I see one more person write that Jay-Z is fake or is a pussy im gonna go fucking insane. The beauty of the Jay-Z vs. Nas battle was that they are both lyrically brilliant, they both have lived what they say and are straight from some of the most infamous housing projects, or 'hoods' in New York City and every accusation they made about eachother being fake was a lie. Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls were like fucking best friends (besides Puff) so of course they are gonna take some bars from eachother. Wait, who was in the two best collaborations Notorious B.I.G has ever done? Oh yeah - Jay-Z (Brooklyns Finest, I Love the Dough). Hes fake even though he was a huge drug dealer, and stabbed a guy just for leaking bootlegs of his album into the street (OH HE FUCKING FAKED THAT, OK THATS A FUCKING SMART THING TO SAY CONSIDERING THAT LANCE RIVERA MADE A PUBLIC STATEMENT THAT HE SAW JAY WALK OVER TO HIM IN THE CLUB AND STAB HIM). If he was that fake and that much of a pussy would 'The Game' throw positive lines at him in pretty much everyone of his songs and describe him as a legend? Just because he fucking makes songs that the mainstream pop audience likes doesnt mean hes a motherfucking fake and anyone who knows anything about Rap and its history knows that, if u disagree your a fucking moron and u shouldnt be allowed to listen to rap music.  \n",
