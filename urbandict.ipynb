       "2619  Kenpo is a Japanese Martial Arts form. However, unlike Karate, its origins are linked back to China and still have very strong influences from Chinese systems. The name, 'kenpo,' also sometimes spelled 'kempo,' is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese character 'chuan' and 'fa.' Literally translates, it means 'the method of the fist/hand.' This seems to be a very close translation into Chinese of what 'karate-te-do' means and might have come about as a means to bridge a language divide between the two countries.  \n",
